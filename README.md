# Roboclaw Library
This is a library designed for easy integration of BasicMicro Roboclaw speed controllers with C++ code in ROS. It is based on the [Arduino Library](http://downloads.ionmc.com/code/arduino.zip) written by BasicMicro with modifications to use any unix style serial port. 

It is modified to be built using Ament as a ROS2 library for easy usage in any ROS2 node and/or package.

Please note that this is a development branch and has yet to be verified and tested. As such, bugs are not unlikely. Please report them!
